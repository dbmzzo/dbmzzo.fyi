I'm Dan, a front-end developer with more than ten years of experience. I've built everything from vanilla HTML to richly interactive applications and visualizations. My focus lately has been on building React-based UI component libraries and composable charts, but I'm always excited by any opportunity to dive deep into new challenges and subject areas.
