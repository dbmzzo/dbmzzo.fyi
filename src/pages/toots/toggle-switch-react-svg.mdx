## Build an Accessible Toggle Switch with React and SVG

### Overview

I wanted a toggle switch that would match this site's visual style and render
consistently across browsers, and I wanted to reuse it easily in other parts of
my site.

Most browsers use native OS inputs or draw their own custom controls, and I've 
never enjoyed the process of restyling form controls with CSS. That's why I
decided to start from scratch with SVG.

I also wanted the switch to be accessible, responsive to keyboard navigation,
and accurately reflect `focus`, `checked`, and `diabled` states. To this end, I
started with a standard checkbox control and use CSS to hide it and bind the
control's states to the SVG. In addition to preserving accessibility, this
approach means we don't need to keep track of any state within our component.

An example of the switch in use can be seen in the header of this site, and it
toggles a vertical rhythm grid. I implement it like this:

```js
<Toggle
  checked 
  label="Toggle Grid"
  ariaLabel="Toggle vertical rhythm grid" 
  handleChange={toggleGrid}
/>
```

<p>
  <Toggle label="Toggle Grid" />
</p>

#### SVG? In a Form Control? 

There are well-worn techniques for restyling inputs with CSS, so why introduce
SVG into the mix?

It's a personal preference. I've never loved using CSS for drawing because, as
anyone who has ever tried to draw a triangle with CSS knows, it has its
limitations.

SVG is designed for drawing, so why not use it? It certainly adds complexity in
the form of additional DOM elements, offers far more opportunity for
customization.

I think it's more fun, too.

#### What About Accessibility?

This custom control preserves the keyboard navigation, focus, aria-label of of
a standard checkbox because it's backed by and tightly coupled to a standard
checkbox control.

### Let's Build It!

#### Start with a Input Component

To get started, let's create a basic functional component with an associated stylesheet.

To ensure that our custom control works as much like a standard input as possible,
we'll use a standard input behind the scenes:

```js
import React from 'react';
import './toggle.css';

const Toggle = () => {
  return (
    <label className="toggle">
      <input type="checkbox" />
    </label>
  );
};

export default Toggle;
```

> Note that we put the input inside the `<label>` tag. This creates an implicit
> association between the input and label and lets us avoid using `htmlFor` or
> a unique `id` in case we have multiple controls on a page, while still
> allowing us to toggle the input by interacting with label.

#### Add Properties

There are a number of properties that we'll need our `<Toggle />` component to accept. Let's
start with the most essential:

- `checked` boolean for the toggle's default condition
- `disabled` boolean for the toggle's disabled condition
- `label` string for text label
- `ariaLabel` string for accessible screen reader description

Let's destructure those properties at the top of the function...

```js
const Toggle = ({ checked, label, disabled }) => {
```

...and render them:

```js{3-6,9}
<label className="toggle">
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    disabled={disabled}
    defaultChecked={checked}
    ariaLabel={ariaLabel}
  />
  <span className="text-label">
    {label}
  </span>
  ...
```

> Note that we use the input's `defaultChecked` instead of the `checked`
> property. To learn more about why, read
> [this article from the React team](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)

Now you should have a checkbox that behaves identically to a native checkbox,
but with a built-in label that we can interact with. See, we're already making
our lives easier:

<Toggle standard label="Boring Checkbox"/>

```js
<Toggle label="Boring Checkbox"/>
```

<Toggle checked standard label="Boring Checked Checkbox"/>

```js
<Toggle checked label="Boring Checked Checkbox"/>
```

<Toggle standard disabled label="Boring Disabled Checkbox"/>

```js
<Toggle checked disabled label="Boring Disabled Checkbox"/>
```

#### Add Custom SVG

Let's add our custom SVG. The simplest possible slide toggle consists of a
**knob** that moves horizontally within a **channel** or track. Let's start
with two rectangles and round their corners with the `rx` attribute:

> I wasn't sure at first whether I wanted rounded or rectangular shapes, and the `rx` attribute
> let me experiment without having to switch between `rect` and `circle` shapes.

```js{9-26}
return (
  <label className="toggle">
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      disabled={disabled}
      defaultChecked={checked}
      ariaLabel={ariaLabel}
    />
    <svg height="24px" viewBox="0,0 48,24">
      <rect
        className="channel"
        x="0"
        y="0"
        rx="12"
        width="48"
        height="24"
      />
      <rect
        className="knob"
        x="4"
        y="4"
        rx="8"
        width="16"
        height="16"
      />
    </svg>
    <span className="text-label">
      {label}
    </span>
  </label>
);
```

#### Hide the Input Element

Before hiding the input element, ensure that it gets toggled when you click or tap
on your new SVG.

Once you've done that, we can hide the `input` with the following style:

```css
input[type="checkbox"] {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Note that we can't use `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` because doing so
removes our ability to interact with the native input.

#### Style the SVG Shapes

I use [custom CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) on my site, so my stylesheet looks something like this:

```css
:root {
  --text-color: #24282d;
  --highlight-color: #D9D6D4;
  --pop-color: #D92B2B;
  );
}

.channel {
  fill: var(--highlight-color);
}

.knob {
  fill: var(--text-color);
}

```

#### Checked Styles

We need a way to let the `checked` condition of our native input to control the
style of our knob element. Doing so is easy using [the general sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator)
in conjunction with the [checked pseudo-class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked):

```css
:checked ~ svg .knob {
  /* checked styles here */
}
```

This rule targets `.knob` elements that are descendants of `svg` elements that
are themselves siblings of any element that has a `checked` attribute.

Change the color of the knob and move it `24px` to the right:

```css{2-3}
:checked ~ svg .knob {
  fill: var(--pop-color);
  transform: translateX(24px);
}
```

The knob now moves and changes color when you click on it.

We want these changes to be animated, so update the basic `.knob` rule like so:

```css{3-4}
.knob {
  fill: var(--text-color);
  transition: transform .25s, fill .25s;
  transform-box: fill-box;
}
```

> The `transform-box: fill box;` line may be unfamiliar. Sometimes [SVG
> elements behave differently from standard HTML elements when applying
> transforms](https://css-tricks.com/transforms-on-svg-elements/), and this
> rule helps them act like their HTML counterparts.

#### Disabled Styles

We can use a similar technique for the disabled state, but targeting all
siblings (in this case our SVG and the label):

```css
:disabled ~ .text-label {
  opacity: .5;
}
```

#### Focus Highlight

There are a number of ways we could indicate when the toggle is the focused
element.  I chose to add a third shape to my SVG, an inset highlight:

```js{10-17}
<svg height="24px" viewBox="0,0 48,24">
  <rect
    className="channel"
    x="0"
    y="0"
    rx="12"
    width="48"
    height="24"
  />
  <rect
    className="focus-highlight"
    x="1"
    y="1"
    rx="11"
    width="46"
    height="22"
  />
  <rect
    className="knob"
    x="4"
    y="4"
    rx="8"
    width="16"
    height="16"
  />
</svg>
```

Make the highlight invisible in its non-focused state:

```css
.focus-highlight {
  fill: none;
  stroke: none;
  stroke-width: 0;
  tansition: stroke, stroke-width
}
```

And visible in its focused state:

```css
:focus ~ svg .focus-highlight {
  stroke-width: 2;
  stroke: var(--pop-color);
}
```

#### Call a Function on Toggle

The point of this whole exercise is to toggle something, so let's add a function
to our component properties:

```js{5}
const Toggle = ({
  checked,
  label,
  disabled,
  handleChange
}) => {
```

And call that function when the input is toggled:

```js{6}
<input
  type="checkbox"
  disabled={disabled}
  defaultChecked={checked}
  ariaLabel={ariaLabel}
  handleChange={handleChange}
/>
```

#### Presto!

There you have it -- a totally custom-designed, keyboard and screen-reader
accessible, slide toggle backed by a native input.

### Next Steps

There are still lots of things we can do to make our shiny new toggle even
shinier.  Here are some ideas for improvements:

- Incorporate the [indeterminate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox)
- state into the component.
- Add size classes to make `small` and `large` versions of the toggle
