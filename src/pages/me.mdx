## Hello

I've been practicing front-end development for more than ten years, and have
focused lately on building composable charts, UI component libraries, and
diving deep into SVG.

Away from the keyboard, my [wife and I visited over 30 national parks in our camper](https://instagram.com/patrick_the_van).

This site is an exercise in organizing my thoughts on subjects that I'm
currently exploring, and to keep a record of tools and techniques that I may
want to refer back to in the future.

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto://dmatarazzo@fastmail.com).

You can also [read my CV](/cv).

Yours,  
Sincerely,  
All the best,  
Warm regards,  

**Dan**
