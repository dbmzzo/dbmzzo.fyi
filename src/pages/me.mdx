## Hello

I'm a front-end developer with more than ten years of experience.
My focus lately has been on building UI component libraries, composable charts,
and diving deep into SVG.

Away from the keyboard, my [wife and I visited over 30 national parks in our camper](https://instagram.com/patrick_the_van).

This site is an attempt to organize my thoughts on subjects that I'm currently
exploring, and to keep a record of tools and techniques that I may want to refer back to
in the future.

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto://dmatarazzo@fastmail.com).

You can also [read my CV](/cv).

Yours,  
Sincerely,  
All the best,  
Warm regards,  

**Dan**
