## Hello

I'm a front-end developer with more than ten years of experience.
My focus lately has been on building React-based UI component libraries, composable charts,
and diving deep with SVG.

Please feel free to get in touch.

Sincerely,  
Best,  
Regards,  
All the best,  
Warm regards,  
Yours,  
Thanks,
