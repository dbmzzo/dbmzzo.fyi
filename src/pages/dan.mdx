## Hello

I'm a front-end developer with more than ten years of experience.
My focus lately has been on building UI component libraries, composable charts,
and diving deep into SVG.

This site is an attempt to organize my thoughts  on subjects that I'm currently
exploring, and to keep a record of tools and techniques that I may want to refer back to
in the future.

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto://dmatarazzo@fastmail.com).

Sincerely,  
Best,  
Regards,  
All the best,  
Warm regards,  
Yours,  
Thanks,  

**Dan**
